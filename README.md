# MIDI

To generate a random MIDI file, I can use a pre-trained machine learning model that has been trained on a large dataset of MIDI files. The model can learn the patterns and structures of MIDI files and generate new ones based on the patterns it has learned.

First of all, install the package called MIDIUtil: ```pip install MIDIUtil```

## Random MIDI
Here is an example of generating a random MIDI file using Python and the MIDIUtil library: 

Copy the code from **```RandomMIDI.py```**

This code generates a MIDI file with 16 random notes with pitches between 40 and 80 and velocities between 80 and 127. You can adjust the parameters as needed to generate a MIDI file with different characteristics. Once the file is generated, you can play it using a MIDI player or a music software that supports MIDI files.

## Beautiful MIDI
To build a beautiful MIDI file using Python, you can use various techniques to create complex and expressive musical compositions. Here are a few suggestions:
1. Use multiple tracks: A MIDI file can have multiple tracks, each with its own instrument and melody. You can use different tracks to create harmonies, counterpoints, and variations.
2. Use different instruments: MIDI files can simulate a wide range of instruments, from pianos and guitars to drums and orchestral instruments. You can use different instruments to create different moods and textures.
3. Use velocity and expression: Velocity and expression are MIDI parameters that control the volume and timbre of each note. You can use these parameters to create dynamics, accents, and articulations.
4. Use rhythmic variations: You can create interest and complexity in your MIDI file by using rhythmic variations such as syncopation, polyrhythms, and tempo changes.
Here is an example code snippet that uses these techniques to create a beautiful MIDI file:

Copy the code from **```BeautifulMIDI.py```**

This code generates a MIDI file with three tracks. The first track plays a simple melody using the C major chord, while the second track plays a variation of the melody with lower velocity. The third track provides a rhythm section using bass drum and hi-hat samples. The resulting MIDI file has a beautiful and expressive sound that demonstrates the power of MIDI sequencing with Python.
